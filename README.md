## React Query Demo

Demo from my presentation on custom hooks and react query for React Chicago 03/31/2021.

The code before `react-query` is on the `demo-before` branch, and the code after `react-query` is on the `demo-after` branch.

### Setup
You will need MongoDB running locally on port 27017 with a database named `react-query-demo` and a collection named `people`.

Use `npm run dev` to start the project.
